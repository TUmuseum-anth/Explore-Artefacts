        <!-- Detailed Description -->
        <p>
            Benjarong is a type of traditional Thai porcelain, typically known for its vibrant, multi-colored enamel decorations. 
            The name "Benjarong" comes from the Sanskrit words "benja" (meaning five) and "rong" (meaning color), referring to 
            the five basic colors often used in the intricate hand-painted designs: black, white, green, red, and yellow. 
            These colors are meticulously applied in layers, often in floral, geometric, or mythical patterns that hold deep 
            cultural significance in Thailand.<br><br>

            Originating from royal courts, Benjarong was once used exclusively by the Thai monarchy and noble families, 
            often as part of religious or ceremonial sets. It symbolizes opulence, tradition, and Thai craftsmanship. 
            Today, Benjarong is still made using traditional techniques and is highly sought after both for its historical 
            value and as a symbol of Thai heritage. The process of creating Benjarong porcelain is complex, involving 
            several firings to fix the colors and create the characteristic glossy finish that makes it so unique.
